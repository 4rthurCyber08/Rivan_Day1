Hierarchical Network Design
1. What is the most important part of a network? The Core

Most common kinds of network architectures.
 - 2-tier                 Cisco Collapsed Campus Core
 - 3-tier                 Enterprise Network Design
 - Spine-leaf             Data Center Fabric

CORE Layer (CoreTAAS & CoreBABA) - High Speed and Availability
  "A Network Engineer MUST avoid a single point of failure.
   Always have a backup."
   
   ex. Etherchannel

  - FlexStack (Master Switch)      Cisco 6500 Series
  - VSS (Single logical switch)    NXOS 9k
  - SSO (Stateful Switchover)
  - NSF (Non-stop Forwarding)


Wired and wireless network.
