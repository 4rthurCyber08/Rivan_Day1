Build your own network. 

KNOW YOUR NETWORK - Network Topology

Hierarchical Network Design
1. What is the most important part of a network? The Core

Most common kinds of network architectures.
 - 2-tier                 Cisco Collapsed Campus Core
 - 3-tier                 Enterprise Network Design
 - Spine-leaf             Data Center Fabric

CORE Layer (CoreTAAS & CoreBABA) - High Speed and Availability
  "A Network Engineer MUST avoid a single point of failure.
   Always have a backup."
   
   ex. Etherchannel

  - FlexStack (Master Switch)      Cisco 6500 Series
  - VSS (Single logical switch)    NXOS 9k
  - SSO (Stateful Switchover)
  - NSF (Non-stop Forwarding)


Wired and wireless network.
2. How many devices do you have right now that can connect to the internet?
  "A network must be Flexible. Reliable. AVAILABLE."

Wireless Controller & Autonomous AP

Wifi standards | IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)
  https://standards.ieee.org/beyond-standards/the-evolution-of-wi-fi-technology-and-standards/

  - WiFi 6     IEEE 802.11ax
  - WiFi 7     IEEE P802.11be


Implement security solutions.
3. What is more valuable than gold? Data

Network security infrastructure
 - NGFW, UTM, IDS
 - Security Policies     Windows Local Security Policy
 - Surveillance          IP Cameras (CAM6 & CAM8)


Enterprise Communication
4. How often are meetings conducted in your work place?

Unified Communications and Collaboration.
  https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/unified-communications/index.html

  - VOIP (ePhone)
  - POTS (Analog)


Connectivity
5. What is the maximum distance of a UTP cable? 100m? 
  - LAN                  Local Area Network
  - WAN                  Wide Area Network

PLDT Home vs PLDT Enterprise
  - MAN                  Metropolitan Area Network
                         PLDT Enterprise Metro Ethernet

Transport technologies:
  - Leased Line
  - SDWAN
  - MPLS VPLS            Pseudowire, L3 & L2
  - VPN                  EVPN
